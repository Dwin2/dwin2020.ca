          The Personal Project is designed to cultivate individual interests by providing us with an opportunity to pursue areas we are passionate about. For me, this was bringing positive change to society while focusing on the realm of algorithms. That's when I discovered algorithmic bias, an increasingly prevalent social justice issue as technology and artificial intelligence becomes a larger and larger part of our society.
        <br> <br> 
        It's rooted in models amplifying human biases through discriminatory assumptions made in the machine training process. Why do some hiring programs disproportionately accept one group of applicants over another? That's algorithmic bias at work. For my Personal Project, I'm creating an application that informs viewers about the bias present in various sources by calculating and assigning an index to each.
