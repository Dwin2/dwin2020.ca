        Salsomaggiore Terme, Italy hosted the 7th World Youth
        Transnational Bridge Championships from August 7th to
        14th, 2022. Having won two gold medals in both the pairs and teams event, here is my personal account of the competition:
        <br> <br> 
        First, I was quite fortunate. After two tiring years of a
        pandemic, I was aged 15, and playing with 13-year-old Indian
        prodigy Anshul Bhatt; I barely qualified for the Under 16
        division. We played six days of endless bridge together
        (the 7th and last day was an individual event), and our
        teammates for the Teams event were two solid Estonian
        players. In preparation, and to familiarize myself once more
        with in-person bridge, I played two tournaments before
        Italy: the Toronto Regional and the Providence NABCs,
        both in July. 
        <br> <br> 
        The pairs event went by far more smoothly than the teams.
        We earned a gold medal as the only pair to score a 60%
        game. Much of this was thanks to a good start in the first
        couple of days that greatly boosted our confidence and
        breezed us through the qualifiers. Our first board had our
        opponents going off two in 5D, and the second is below:

        Sitting South, I reached 4H after a stable auction that
        included a mild slam try. After a club lead won by East
        and a club return, 11 tricks were secured. But it was
        matchpoints, and I knew it would not be enough. I wanted
        to seize the opportunity of my opponent failing to switch
        to a diamond. This being said, my hopes for a 12th trick
        largely lay with a favorable distribution in spades or some
        kind of squeeze with West having both DA and SQ10. This
        became considerably easier after I drew trumps, crossed
        to dummy with a club, and led a spade, East inserting the
        10. Something about it seemed like it was top of nothing,
        so I took the ace and cashed all my winners in hearts and
        clubs. West came down to SQ and DA, and when I played
        a spade from hand, I claimed, winning the last trick with
        the S9. 12 tricks meant 87.28% when 11 tricks would have
        scored an exact 50%. 
        <br> <br>
        “Well played,” my partner said, as we both seemed
        visibly content with the result, despite not knowing the
        percentage at the time. This board helped us in winning the
        gold medal of the pairs event.
        <br> <br>
        Teams were a bit crazier. It was a close final between us
        (Blitz) and our opponents (USS Unsinkable). A bad start
        had us down by 10 at the half. The entire match came
        down to a couple of swing boards, one of which was the
        first board of the third set:

        I sat West. What a whacky hand! EW, have a 13-card club fit,
        and NS are cold for 6D. 6H goes down on a D lead, which
        my Lightner double was trying to indicate. My partner,
        perhaps due to pressure, forgot our agreement and led
        a spade. This, however, tricked the declarer, who thought
        I was doubling on strength. As a result, declarer won the
        spade and took the heart finesse immediately, playing me
        for HQ10x(x). What happened next is quite unfortunate for
        NS. My partner won, and this time switched to a D, which I
        ruffed. Cashing my spade meant 2 down and +300 for our
        side. In combination with our teammates making 6D, 15
        imps were gained for our side. 
        <br> <br>
        Everyone made a mistake on this board but me. North
        should consider the possibility of my Double as Lightner,
        South should choose 6D over 6H as a much safer slam, and
        my partner should undoubtedly have led a diamond. No
        hard feelings though, since after the board all four of us
        laughed at the craziness of the deal, most of us never having
        seen a 13-card fit. 
        <br> <br>
        This board put us back into the lead, albeit briefly. The
        swings continued and we didn’t take and hold the lead until
        the fourth quarter. But the deal sure helped us win the gold
        medal!
        <br> <br>
        The true highlight of the tournament was not with the
        medals, but simply with playing with and against
        juniors from around the world. This tournament was a true
        embodiment of the spirit of youth bridge. The memories
        and friends I made will last forever. Salsomaggiore was a
        nice place too: the pizza and pasta were extraordinary. 
        <br> <br>
        I would definitely do this again.
