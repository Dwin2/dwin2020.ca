          The Personal Project is designed to cultivate individual interests by providing us with an opportunity to pursue areas we are passionate about. For me, this was bringing positive change to society while focusing on the realm of algorithms. That's when I discovered algorithmic bias, an increasingly prevalent social justice issue as technology and artificial intelligence becomes a larger and larger part of our society.
        <br> <br> 
        As of 2023, Corporations are increasingly turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and machine learning models to automate basic decision-making processes. To implement this process, computers follow a strict set of rules, or an algorithm, for their calculations. While these algorithms have widespread benefits, research has revealed some troubling harms in which the nature of algorithmic decision-making was found to reflect human biases. This issue, known as algorithmic bias, has been dominant in society, undermining equal opportunity and exacerbating oppression. 
        <br> <br>
        <u>Three Examples of Algorithmic Bias</u>
        <br> <br>
        1. Hiring Programs
        <br> <br>
        <img class="hiring-img" src="../img/halgo.png" alt="Bias in Hiring Algorithms">
        <br><br>
        A lot of hiring programs have been exposed to accepting different groups of applicants disproportionately. Societal factors have been influencing the algorithm’s decision-making process and causing the unjustified labeling of different groups of people as favorable or unfavorable candidates. A lot of minorities are significantly disadvantaged, as algorithms tend to misinterpret the lack of candidates from a specific ethnic group or race as being unfavorable. 
        <br> <br>
        The most notable example is from Amazon, where a 2015 study found Amazon’s algorithm to be biased against women. The algorithm was subsequently ditched and the company lessened its reliance on AI. 
        <br> <br>
        2. Media Sources
        <br> <br>
        <img class="media-img" src="../img/media.png" alt="Bias in Media Sources">
        <br> <br>
        In media sources, algorithms have an inconsistent prioritization of ideas, leading to unjust patterns in its algorithmically generated trending and recommended pages. Certain ideas are amplified more than others. Since media is designed to maximize viewer attention, its algorithms can redirect viewers in problematic ways. Content filtering has the common problem of over-recommending polarized topics. 
        <br> <br>
        Researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology conducted a study to see how algorithms recommending news stories create filter bubbles that influence readers’ political views. Among its findings was that viewers with more extreme views were shown less diverse content.
